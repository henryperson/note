# note

Note is a very light weight note CLI tool. It assumes you have a `$HOME/notes` directory, and will create files in that directory for note taking.

The usage is as follows:
- `help`: see usage.
- `new`: create a note file for today.
- `open`: open today's note file.

Open only works if you have VS Code installed and the `code` binary in your `$PATH` ([this one](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/command-line)).

To install, clone the directory and run `./install.sh`.
